        <p>
          During the Summer 2025 term, I completed a four-month co-op placement as a Software Developer at Flywheel. This report highlights my work, the goals 
          I set for myself, key projects I contributed to, and the personal and professional growth I experienced. My hope is that this website provides insight 
          into my development as a developer and a team member during my time at Flywheel so far, as I continue my journey with the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my co-op at Flywheel, my main responsibility was building new UI components and features using React and TypeScript, closely following 
          specifications from the senior product manager. Early in the term, I developed a custom container component for the multiplatform-view (MPV) page, 
          which gives users a unified experience for managing campaigns across different platforms and devices. This helped improve both navigation and accessibility
          for our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also worked on enhancing the save filter modal for the Budget Optimizer page. The Budget Optimizer at Flywheel is an AI-driven tool designed to help 
          clients maximize their advertising spend by providing data-driven recommendations for budget allocation. By improving the save filter feature, I made it 
          easier for users to personalize and manage their budgeting preferences, making the tool even more intuitive and valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I contributed to improving tooltip functionality, allowing users to access helpful information without cluttering the interface. Alongside 
          building new features, I was responsible for fixing bugs and iterating on my work based on feedback from the team. I also had the chance to work with a 
          senior developer to investigate a complex backend issue, which gave me valuable insight into full stack web development and helped me improve my 
          problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the more technically challenging projects involved updating the table formatting logic to support both standard title case and special terms that 
          needed to remain in all caps. Solving this required a mix of creative problem-solving and attention to detail, as I needed to ensure consistency and 
          clarity across the application. Later in the term, I led the integration of Zod for client-side validation, which improved the reliability and 
          maintainability of our forms and modals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technical tasks, I actively participated in daily standups, and sprint planning. These experiences helped me sharpen my communication 
          skills and taught me how to effectively collaborate within an agile team environment. I learned how to present my work to both technical and non-technical
          audiences, and I became more proactive in seeking feedback and offering support to my teammates. My team members were always kind and willing to help whenever
          I had questions, which made it easy to learn and grow throughout the term. In addition to working with my immediate team, I also had the opportunity to meet 
          and interact with people from other teams, which broadened my understanding of the company and gave me insight into different areas of the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my co-op, I also tackled various bug fixes and performance optimizations, such as improving filter validation logic in modals and streamlining 
          component rendering for better responsiveness. These tasks, while sometimes less visible, were vital to the overall user experience and stability of the 
          platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working at Flywheel has been an invaluable opportunity to deepen my frontend web development skills and gain firsthand experience in building scalable, 
          user-centric applications. The technical challenges I encountered pushed me to find innovative solutions, and the collaborative culture helped me grow as 
          both a developer and a team member. I look forward to applying these skills and lessons to future roles in software engineering.

      <section id="goals">
  <h2 class="text-primary border-bottom pb-2">Work Term Goals</h2>

  <p>
    <span class="goal-heading">
      Learning Goal #1: I want to improve my ability to communicate complex technical ideas clearly and effectively to both technical and 
      non-technical audiences, adapting my communication style based on the context and audience.
    </span>
    <br>
    Throughout my co-op, I focused on improving my integrative communication skills in various settings. In a meeting with 50 people, I demoed some of 
    the initial tickets I worked on. The presentation went well, I showed my code and explained my thought process. I received constructive feedback from 
    my teammates, who congratulated me on my first demo and encouraged me to keep presenting. At daily standups, I initially had some trouble clearly 
    delivering my thoughts, but as time went on, my confidence and explanation skills improved. I also became more comfortable reaching out to teammates 
    for help, which strengthened my collaborative skills. Overall, these experiences helped me become a more confident and effective communicator in technical
    environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="goal-heading">
      Learning Goal #2: I want to enhance my creative thinking skills by designing and implementing innovative features or improvements in the 
      projects I contribute to, particularly in areas like user experience, optimization, or automation.
    </span>
    <br>
    During my co-op, I made it a point to think creatively when working on new features and improvements. One project involved designing a UI container 
    with a button and a link to help users navigate more easily. After team feedback, I revised the design to better fit their needs, and the final version 
    received positive feedback. For the tooltip feature, I suggested changes that made it more user-friendly, and my idea ended up being used in production. 
    I also solved a tricky issue where table text needed to be mostly title case, except for specific terms in all caps, and I found a way to handle both. 
    Overall, I'm proud of the creative solutions I brought to the team and how they made a difference in our final product.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="goal-heading">
      Learning Goal #3: I aim to strengthen my problem-solving skills by effectively analyzing technical challenges and implementing efficient, scalable 
      solutions within full-stack development projects.
    </span>
    <br>
    During my summer co-op, I focused on tackling non-trivial technical challenges and finding efficient solutions. For example, I improved data formatting 
    logic for tables, resulting in a clearer interface. Another challenge was formatting table labels so that most words appeared in title case while certain 
    terms stayed in all caps. I implemented a custom function to handle this, based on best practices I researched. For my last ticket, I addressed a tricky 
    filter name validation issue in a modal by introducing Zod for declarative validation and refactoring save logic. These experiences boosted my confidence 
    and independence as a problem solver, and I now feel more capable of breaking down complex problems and solving them step by step.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="goal-heading">
      Learning Goal #4: I aim to improve my personal organization and time management skills to consistently meet deadlines, balance multiple tasks, and 
      contribute reliably to team goals in a fast-paced development environment.
    </span>
    <br>
    During my co-op, I prioritized improving my organization and time management so I could meet deadlines and support my team. I completed tickets on time, 
    even when juggling multiple responsibilities. For example, I shipped a new container feature and tooltip in React ahead of a bug bash, which contributed 
    to a smoother workflow. When things got busy, I learned to start tickets earlier and switch tasks if I got stuck. I also became better at estimating how 
    long tasks would take and breaking down tickets into manageable pieces. Moving forward, I plan to keep refining my time management by setting clearer goals
    for each sprint and prioritizing tasks more strategically.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="goal-heading">
      Learning Goal #5: I want to develop my ability to work effectively as part of a software engineering team by contributing consistently, communicating 
      openly, and supporting team goals and collaboration.
    </span>
    <br>
    Throughout my co-op, I prioritized being an effective team member by contributing consistently and communicating openly. I received positive feedback 
    from my teammates and manager for my collaboration and willingness to ask for help when needed. I also supported others when they had questions or 
    challenges, and I worked closely with a teammate to develop a new saving filter feature using React. These experiences helped me grow as a collaborator 
    and reinforced the importance of teamwork. Looking ahead, I aim to further enhance my teamwork skills by seeking out opportunities to pair program, 
    participate in team discussions, and support others whenever possible.

          my manager, Navneet Singh, for trusting me with meaningful projects and supporting my growth as a frontend web developer. I also appreciate my co-op 
          supervisor, Jacob Wadsworth, who provided valuable guidance throughout the term, and my technical buddy, Andrei Markov, who was always there to answer 
          my questions and help me work through technical challenges. I'm thankful for the collaborative and welcoming environment at Flywheel, which made this a 
          truly great experience.</p>
